She typically holds a title of nobility and may be involved in royal duties, charities, or public appearances. In fairy tales, princesses are often portrayed as kind, beautiful, and in need of rescue, but in reality, their roles and responsibilities vary greatly depending on their country and cultural context."}

She is the daughter of King Drupada and Queen Draupadi, and is often associated with her sister Draupadi, who is known for being married to the five Pandava brothers. Vrushali, however, did not marry and remained unmarried throughout her life. She is not a central character in the epic but is mentioned in some narratives, often depicted as a loyal and respectful sister to Draupadi."}
